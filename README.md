# Machine Learning Esophageal Cancer Diagnosis
This project aims to investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing esophageal cancer using biochemical data. The project focuses on using raw data output from biochemical labs to predict the presence of esophageal cancer in patients.

## Background
Esophageal cancer is a deadly disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis is key to increasing survival rates, but traditional diagnostic methods such as endoscopy can be invasive and costly. This project aims to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to diagnose esophageal cancer using raw biochemical data, which could potentially lead to a faster, cheaper, and less invasive diagnosis.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of biochemical data from patients with healthy esophagi, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer. The dataset contains over 1,000 records of various biochemical markers, such as albumin, globulin, and creatinine, among others. The data was collected from various medical centers and research institutions, and has been cleaned and preprocessed for use in machine learning algorithms.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
The project uses several machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of esophageal cancer in patients, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The algorithms are trained on the dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Usage
To use this project, you will need to have Python and several Python packages installed, including Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. You can clone the repository and run the scripts provided to preprocess the data, train and evaluate the machine learning algorithms, and make predictions on new data. You can also explore the Jupyter notebooks provided to visualize the data and results.

## Contributors
This project was developed by Robert Franklin, Marisa Duong, Brianna? as part of their capstone project for their data analytics course. They welcome contributions from other data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and medical professionals who are interested in improving the diagnosis of esophageal cancer.
